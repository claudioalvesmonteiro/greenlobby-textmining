Current effort. It is a fact that Brazil has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions significantly in recent years, mainly due to the reduction of emissions associated with deforestation in the Amazon. However, despite much lower rates than previous years, the loss of area of ​​native forests is still significant and the country is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases due to changes in land use. In addition, the country has as one of the objectives of its National Plan on Climate Change the elimination of the net loss of the forest cover area, an objective that, according to the National Plan, should be reached in 2015. And the emissions of all other sectors (energy, agriculture, industrial processes and waste) have been increasing over time. There is, therefore, room for reducing emissions in all sectors of our economy, which should be reflected in the definition of an ambitious Nationally Designated Contribution for Brazil for the post-2020 period.



Possible impacts of adopting mitigation measures. The positive effects on the planet's climate, the benefits for increasing the efficiency of different sectors of our economy, the generation of jobs related to clean technologies, and the savings generated by the reduction of the impacts that could be caused by climate change, as a result inaction, will be much higher, over time, than the cost of investing in mitigation actions. And there are some mitigation options that can have a negative rebate cost.



Mode. The IPCC message on its 5th. Assessment Report is exhaustive - it is still possible to achieve the objective of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. But for this to happen, there must be a great effort of collective and coordinated mitigation among nations. Global emissions need to peak in the coming years. And then follow a path of accelerated progressive reductions to make the necessary actions feasible in time to prevent global warming from exceeding two degrees. It is necessary, therefore, that countries commit themselves to emission reduction or limitation targets for the whole economy that are quantifiable in absolute terms, in terms of total emissions in tons of CO2eq. Sectoral actions or policies must be the means to achieve the absolute goals, and can support the goal, and must be included in the details and registration of the "Nationally Determined Contributions" with the UNFCCC.



Period or duration of the Nationally Designated Contribution. The negotiation of goals for a period of 5 years presupposes that a new negotiation occurs, perhaps starting even before the commencement of that commitment period, about future goals, which can result in significant delays and time gaps. On the other hand, a 10-year commitment period is too long for countries to be able to charge for actions and results from the very beginning (which is essential for progress to be made quickly in the world in reducing gas emissions. The Climate Observatory considers the 10-year commitment periods to be the best path, the first period being from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2030, and recommends setting a reduction target emission limit or emission limit for 2030 and an intermediate target for 2025, with a mechanism that allows the revision of these targets in the light of the most recent science, such as new results of the work of the IPCC, whether new evaluation reports or specific analyzes (sector, etc.), in order to ensure the maintenance of the global emissions trajectory within the limit of 2 degrees Celsius.
 
Much has been done; but, considering the dimension and the social and environmental problems of Brazil, one cannot stop growing in a more balanced, imaginative and pluralistic way, both in space and in time.
We believe that it is possible to adapt the emission reduction with new opportunities in areas such as expanding the green economy; change in the transportation matrix; advances in agriculture; urban improvements.
We understand that economic growth should not be an unquestionable dogma or condition for climate policy actions. It is incompatible on the world stage and in the Brazilian context in particular to think only of “win-win” scenarios, with mitigation and growth.



In addition, the trade off between growth and emissions reduction is related to the type or pattern of growth of each country. In the case of Brazil, the energy-intensive extractive-export dynamic has and will have future impacts on gas emissions and climate impact and cannot be neglected in terms of future costs in efforts to reduce emissions. For example, only the prospects for pre-salt exploration radically change the profile of Brazil's emissions, compared to today, for the post 2020 period



. Therefore, the debate about our standard should be part of the public debate on mitigation efforts. growth.



Regarding the time horizon, we understand that:



2025 is very little time to see any results (thinking that the new agreement should start to take effect from 2020;

2030 gives a whole decade for the international community to see how it works and evaluate the regime and also it gives time for actions to adapt nationally in a more extended horizon.

2050 is a very long horizon, it is to guarantee (even legally) the 'transition' in the horizon that, for example, business lobbies and major investment actors want. We find long-term commitments very complicated and risky, for example, Brazil has to live up to 2020 with the 'commitments' defined in the National Policy on Climate Change that since the end of the last decade (2009) - not so long ago - in peak of agrofuels, placed this element as one of the main pillars of the reduction of emissions in the country, in addition to the expansion of hydroelectric plants and reduction of deforestation 'net' with increment of planted 'forests' (= monocultures). Only five years have passed and the context of the dynamics of development and energy generation is much more complex.




 
 
The construction industry is among the sectors that most contribute to the greenhouse effect, however the advances in the use of new technologies are still incipient, there is a need to define policies to encourage the use of "clean" and economically viable construction systems.
 
 
 
The national mitigation effort has to be made by all national sectors. Although we have achieved a significant reduction in emissions from land use, the other sectors, especially energy, registered an increase in their emissions. The country has the potential to reduce its emissions without this being an impediment to economic and social development, especially through the use of renewable energy sources.
Current effort. It is a fact that Brazil has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions significantly in recent years, mainly due to the reduction of emissions associated with deforestation in the Amazon. However, despite being much lower than rates of previous years, the loss of area of ​​native forests is still significant and the country is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases due to changes in land use. of the objectives of its National Plan on Climate Change the elimination of the net loss of the forest cover area, an objective that, according to the National Plan, should be reached in 2015.

Brazil has actually reduced its emissions significantly since 2004, mainly due to the decrease in deforestation in the Amazon region. Despite this great advance, the Brazilian economy has increased its greenhouse gas emissions in other sectors of great national relevance. The energy and agriculture sector have increased their emissions drastically and have shown trends of continuous increase in the national context.

Emission reduction measures, according to several studies (ex: http://wwf.org.mx/noticias/?215750/Viablelainversindelsectorprivadopomompromovercrecimientoeconmicobajoenemisionesdecarbono) may be associated with continued economic growth, the stability of commitments to maintain environmental quality and the increase and improvement than social indicators. We know that it is possible to guarantee environmental and climate security for the country's social and economic development. We need political will and financial support to ensure that this is achieved.

National contributions must be made in an integrated manner, contemplating three different answers to the third question: base year, reference scenarios, per capita carbon footprint analyzes and sectoral actions to reduce emissions. It is possible to carry out these integrated analyzes that include the elements mentioned above, respecting the question of historical responsibilities, future projections and the need and capacity of each country to reduce its emissions. For example, this calculator: http://www.gdrights.org/calculator/, makes it possible, based on science, to know the real commitment that each country should have to make its national contributions and be a part in maintaining climate well-being global.

The world needs to reach the peak of emissions in the coming years and Brazil, as one of the 7 largest emitters, has a fundamental role in the search for a future of global climate agreement that guarantees a future of climate security for the world. As highlighted by the latest IPCC report, climate urgency is immediate and targets by 2025 and 2030 should be prioritized to put the world and major countries on a route to a low carbon future. Analyzes point out that if measures are not taken in this decade, due to the permanence of gases, their impacts will be very long term, reducing the possibility of holding global warming below 2ºC.

Question 1- Brazil has in fact managed to reduce its emissions from deforestation substantially, and this must be recognized. However, the country has the necessary capacity and responsibility to further reduce emissions in the land use change and forestry sector, as well as in all other sectors.

Question 2 - In addition to the collective benefits of mitigation action being enormous, with positive impacts on health, food security and reduction of extreme events, for example, in the long run, the economic impacts will be even greater if no action is taken now. Brazil has emissions per capita and income per capita above the world average, and needs to fulfill its responsibility to reduce emissions. There are several actions that can, at the same time, bring benefits to the economy, such as improving energy efficiency, developing leadership in low carbon industries and technologies, among others. 

Question 3 - The goal of reducing or limiting emissions for the economy as a whole in relation to one year is necessary, but it should be guided by realistic reduction targets by sector, which should be used as a strategy to reach the goal of the whole economy. This target must also be based on future projections, emissions per capita and historical responsibilities.

Question 4 - Multiple periods with specific targets for 2025 and 2030. In addition to these two targets, it is extremely relevant that there is a process of reviewing the targets and "ratcheing up" so that the 2ºC limit is not reached. Early action measures are absolutely necessary before the treaty is implemented.

Special and strict control of the automobile industry, determining replacement of fossil fuels by renewables. Increased inspection of forest areas in order to combat forest fires and create and implement conservation units and indigenous reserves
 
We believe in sectorial actions in principle, how to act in the sectors that cause the most emissions and that generate the most impacts, such as deforestation and less polluting technologies (clean) for industries. Intensify the education and information for citizens of everyday products (found in supermarkets, for example) that they use since their conception, of clean methodologies and that cause the least possible socio-environmental impact. Intensifying the selective collection and reuse of solid urban waste in large cities, are immediate actions that go against the daily life of the urban citizen.
As a member of the Carta de Belém Group, we have been promoting this debate in recent years. For the group, climate policies should not be thought only from the perspective of economic growth. They must have priority as they imply a deepening of the debate on the need for a new development model, which is compatible with the natural limits of the planet. This applies not only to the developed countries, but also to the developing ones, especially since they are precisely developing, they can think about sustainable development matrices and not repeating the tortuous paths environmentally of the industrialized countries. This also implies a debate on reparation and historical debt by this group of developed countries.



In this sense, the trade off between growth and reduction of emissions is related to the type or pattern of growth of each country. In the case of Brazil, the energy-intensive extractive-export dynamic has and will have future impacts on gas emissions and climate impact and cannot be neglected in terms of future costs in efforts to reduce emissions. For example, only the prospects for pre-salt exploration radically change the profile of Brazil's emissions, compared to today, for the post 2020 period

We argue that it is incompatible to think only of “win-win” scenarios, with mitigation and growth. This goes far from betting on “degrowth”, which would be an answer option to elaborate extensively (as in the previous answer).

We find it too complicated and risky for long-term commitments. For example, Brazil has to live up to 2020 with the 'commitments' defined in the National Policy on Climate Change that, since the end of the last decade (2009), at the height of agrofuels, has placed this element as one of the main pillars of reducing emissions in the country, in addition to the expansion of hydroelectric dams and the reduction of 'liquid' deforestation with an increase in planted 'forests'. Only five years have passed and the context of the dynamics of development and energy generation is much more complex.
 
 
Brazil has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions significantly in recent years, due to the reduction of emissions associated with deforestation in the Amazon, but emissions from other sectors that have data - energy, agriculture, industrial processes and waste - have come increasing over time. Brazil needs to address not only emissions resulting from the loss of area of ​​native forests, which is still significant, but be more ambitious in reducing emissions in all sectors of our economy.



The cost of adopting mitigation measures should not be seen in a narrow and short-term perspective, but as a real strategic investment in the quality of life of the citizens of the country and the world. The positive effects of a low-carbon development model are numerous: increasing efficiency in the use of resources by different sectors of our economy, generating jobs related to clean technologies, among others. The savings generated by the reduction of environmental, social, political and economic impacts that tend to be caused by climate change, due to inaction, will be much higher, over time, than the cost of investing in mitigation actions.



In order to achieve the objective of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, there must be a great effort of collective and coordinated mitigation among nations. We know that global emissions are expected to peak in the coming years. We also know that a large part of the world population lives and will continue to live in the next decade in developing countries. We know, therefore, that the right to economic and social development is a critical dimension of the quest to increase the population's well-being. Development, however, must be understood as something broader than economic growth. The Brazilian contribution should be based on the definition of a national growth and development strategy that is progressively less carbon intensive. It is important to seek greater growth, but not at any cost. It is necessary to grow in a way that is better for everyone.



In view of the history of difficulties inherent to the negotiation process, the negotiation of goals for a period of 5 years presupposes that a new negotiation occurs in a short period of time, which may result in delays and important time gaps. On the other hand, a commitment period of more than 10 years is too long to be able to collect actions and results from countries at the very beginning. We consider the 10-year commitment period to be the best path, the first period being from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2030, and recommends setting an emission reduction target or emission limit for 2030 and an intermediate target for 2025, with a mechanism that allows the review of these targets in the light of the most recent science, accumulated learning and specific assessments and analyzes (sectorial, regional etc.) to be developed.
Current effort. It is a fact that Brazil has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions significantly in recent years, mainly due to the reduction of emissions associated with deforestation in the Amazon. However, despite much lower rates than previous years, the loss of area of ​​native forests is still significant and the country is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases due to changes in land use. In addition, the country has as one of the objectives of its National Plan on Climate Change the elimination of the net loss of the forest cover area, an objective that, according to the National Plan, should be reached in 2015. And the emissions of all other sectors (energy, agriculture, industrial processes and waste) have been increasing over time. There is, therefore, room for reducing emissions in all sectors of our economy, which should be reflected in the definition of an ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution for Brazil for the post-2020 period.



Possible impacts of adopting mitigation measures. The positive effects on the planet's climate, the benefits for increasing the efficiency of different sectors of our economy, the generation of jobs related to clean technologies, and the savings generated by the reduction of the impacts that could be caused by climate change, as a result inaction, will be much higher, over time, than the cost of investing in mitigation actions. And there are some mitigation options that can have a negative rebate cost.



Mode. The IPCC message on its 5th. Assessment Report is exhaustive - it is still possible to achieve the objective of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. But for this to happen, there must be a great effort of collective and coordinated mitigation among nations. Global emissions need to peak in the coming years. And then follow a path of accelerated progressive reductions to make the necessary actions feasible in time to prevent global warming from exceeding two degrees. It is necessary, therefore, that countries commit themselves to emission reduction or limitation targets for the whole economy that are quantifiable in absolute terms, in terms of total emissions in tons of CO2eq. Sectoral actions or policies must be the means to achieve the absolute goals, they can support the goal, and they must be included in the details and registration of the “Nationally Determined Contributions” with the UNFCCC.



Nationally Determined Contribution Period or Duration. The negotiation of goals for a period of 5 years presupposes that a new negotiation occurs, perhaps even before the beginning of the term of that commitment period, about future goals, which can result in delays and important time gaps. On the other hand, a 10-year commitment period is too long to be able to demand actions and results from countries at the beginning of the same period (which is essential for progress to be made quickly worldwide in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. greenhouse effect). The Climate Observatory considers the definition of 10-year commitment periods to be the best path, the first period being from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2030, and recommends that an emission reduction target or limit be set of emissions for 2030 and an intermediate target for 2025, with a mechanism that allows the revision of these targets in the light of the most recent science, such as new results of the work of the IPCC, whether new evaluation reports or specific analyzes (sectorial, regional etc.) , to ensure the maintenance of the trajectory of global emissions within the limit of 2 degrees Celsius.
Justification:

In 2009, Brazil took the important initiative of assuming, even before developed nations, a voluntary commitment to reduce emissions from 36.1 to 38.9.

The effort to achieve the reduction of these emissions and the commitment in the elaboration of the Sectorial Plans for mining, steel, ABC, and other initiatives, as well as the construction of dialogue with different sectors of society has been demonstrating the seriousness that the Brazilian government has been contributing to the theme .

However, the initiatives must also come from the other countries, which should rather establish their own goals, and these must be ambitious in line with their emissions, so it is important that there is a conditioning effort in the reductions with these countries.

Brazil, with this initiative, made the necessary effort for a situation of a nation practically devoid of any commitments regarding the environmental issue, with regard to the reduction of emissions. It is necessary to establish, therefore, that this is a path of no return, especially if we consider that we are in development and that the pre-salt, in addition to its generation of wealth, will be an important source of emissions from fossil fuels.

There are several other sectors of society in which it is possible to reduce emissions, in a governmental, sectoral and social effort, based on the reduction of the environmental impacts generated, especially by the productive sector. In this sense, another government policy that is already in the implementation phase, which is the National Solid Waste Policy, has an important role and, like others, must join these efforts.

The recovery of degraded areas (and pastures) can significantly reduce new and higher emissions.

Question 2:

It does not seem possible to consolidate a sustainable development project for the country, with income distribution, appreciation of work and workers without ensuring environmental balance and for CUT these are expensive challenges that represent commitment and commitment between government and society .

We live in a time when it has been possible to ensure economic growth with initiatives that establish an expressive contribution in reducing emissions through sector plans, projects and specific programs directed to each segment of society, including social participation.

In the scenarios that analyze the trends of advances in the percentage of GHG emissions (Greenhouse Gases) is the energy sector, leading the ranking and even surpassing agriculture.

Being aware of this scenario leads us to the possibility of anticipating initiatives in sources that generate energy that enable greater diversification and less impact on energy production.

It also leads us to structure the articulation between National Plans (Climate Change, Sanitation, Solid Waste, among others) business initiatives, possibilities for technology transfers (including from the relationship established with the BRICs), increase in renewable energies and intensive use of technology in the management of industrial processes.

There is, therefore, a significant diversity of possibilities for ensuring energy efficiency, in addition to other initiatives aimed at reducing emissions in transport, services, and others in the residential sphere that reduce environmental impacts and are initiatives that, added to Environmental Education and policies and programs turned to awareness form a scenario that appears possible to face this challenge. The entire diversity of initiatives must be adopted with a view to the common good and ensuring social and economic potential.

However, any significant modification, such as that of the energy model, in order to become more sustainable, implies important changes for employment, for the requalification needs and in the way of life of these workers. If nothing is done, jobs will be seriously affected, as will life.

 
[1] Brazil has made significant reductions in recent years, but restricted to land use change. In the other 4 sectors considered in the inventories (energy, industrial processes, waste and agriculture) emissions continue to grow at a faster rate than the growth of global emissions. Brazil is still one of the 10 largest GHG emitters on the planet. In terms of emissions per capita since 1990, we had emissions per capita higher than the global average, reaching more than double in the 1990s. Only in the last three years, emissions per capita approached the global average of 7 tCO2e / inhabitant / year.

[2] The scenarios of impacts for Brazil with climate change, pointed out in both the IPCC report and in the PBMC RAN1, are critical and affect mainly the poorest and

least likely (ex. Northeastern hinterland). Both reports show that the safest alternative for tackling climate change is to reduce emissions. Most of the actions to reduce emissions are synergistic with long-term economic and social development. For example, improving engine efficiency leads to savings, improves energy security; basic sanitation and proper disposal of waste reduces emissions while improving health conditions; Pasture recovery increases land profitability and reduces emissions, etc. But just as freedom, democracy, gender equality and the fight against racism should not be put into perspective, sustainability and the goal of curbing global warming should not be put into perspective. To understand the contradiction of the proposition, just replace the value in question above: “is it acceptable for democracy to lead to a reduction in economic activity?” or "Action should be given to racism, without creating an impediment to economic development."

[3] The 5th IPCC report has evolved considerably compared to previous reports and makes it clear that the scenario of a maximum increase of 2oC in the global average temperature can only be achieved (likely in RCP 2.6) with the limitation of emissions in 550 to 1300 GtCO2e between 2011 and 2100, or an annual average of 6.3 to 14.7 Gt / year, and in 2010 we issued 49 Gt (against 36 in 1990) and with an upward trend. Therefore, it is the concept of limiting emissions

accumulated in the period. In view of these data, if we are really engaged with the 2 ° C limit, it does not make sense for

countries to assume relative targets / commitments (eg emissions by GDP, deviation from the reference line or trend scenario), as they will not allow to guarantee that the limits predicted by the

IPCC will be achieved by the sum of the efforts proposed by the countries. Both from a global point of view and from each country, it is necessary to define a limit of accumulated emissions for a certain period (eg X Mtco2 average between years Y and Z).

[4] The Year 2050 should be a reference for an annual emission limit target and accumulated over a long period according to IPCC AR5 (which uses 2050 as a reference). Ex. Accumulated below

850 Gt (2012 to 2050) and emission in 2050 below 14 Gt. This target could be revised in light of the new knowledge of the next IPCC reports. From the long-term target, medium-term targets are defined between 2030 and 2035. In this scenario, a reasonable measure would be a target of 30-35 Gt on average among 2030 and

2035. Emissions per capita - which in the long run are the most effective equity indicator - should serve as a reference to align the share of emissions in countries in the long run (2050).

For example: Considering the forecast of 9 to 9.5 billion inhabitants in 2050 and the emission limits in 2050 compatible with scenarios of 2oC, emissions per capita in the world should

be between 1 and 3 tCO2 / inhab / year. In Brazil, which in 2030 will have, according to IBGE, just under 230 million inhabitants and will already be a developed economy, it is reasonable that at most our emissions per capita are equivalent to the global average, therefore emissions
Question 1- Brazil has in fact managed to reduce its emissions from deforestation substantially, and this must be recognized. However, the country has the necessary capacity and responsibility to further reduce emissions in the land use change and forestry sector, as well as in all other sectors.

Question 2 - In addition to the collective benefits of mitigation action being enormous, with positive impacts on health, food security and reduction of extreme events, for example, in the long run, the economic impacts will be even greater if no action is taken now. Brazil has emissions per capita and income per capita above the world average, and needs to fulfill its responsibility to reduce emissions. There are several actions that can, at the same time, bring benefits to the economy, such as improving energy efficiency, developing leadership in low carbon industries and technologies, among others. 

Question 3 - The goal of reducing or limiting emissions for the economy as a whole in relation to one year is necessary, but it should be guided by realistic reduction targets by sector, which should be used as a strategy to reach the goal of the whole economy. This target must also be based on future projections, emissions per capita and historical responsibilities.

Question 4 - Multiple periods with specific targets for 2025 and 2030. In addition to these two targets, it is extremely relevant that there is a process of reviewing the targets and "ratcheing up" so that the 2ºC limit is not reached. Early action measures are absolutely necessary before the treaty is implemented.
Brazil has substantially reduced its greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation in recent years, which has placed it in a prominent position in relation to other countries at the international level. However, the rate of deforestation in the last year has grown again, indicating, above all, that a broad effort is still needed in this regard and a consistent climate policy, not only to zero deforestation, but also to effectively reduce emissions from other sectors of the economy, with highlights for the agriculture and energy sectors, in order to limit global warming to 2ºC, as the IPCC warns.



In our assessment, the best way to define and quantify a national mitigation contribution is to reduce or limit emissions for the economy as a whole, in relation to future projections, referred to as deviation in the “business as usual” emissions curve. In this way, we can develop more realistic, feasible and compatible targets with the urgency of the scenario of limiting global emissions to 2ºC, taking into account the country's real growth. And, in order to actually create a commitment based on a robust long-term policy, we must consider the 2050 time horizon, clearly establishing interspersed commitments and intervals for monitoring the proposed policies.
We understand that economic growth should not be an unquestionable dogma or condition for climate policy actions. It is incompatible on the world stage and in the Brazilian context in particular to think only of “win-win” scenarios, with mitigation and growth.



In addition, the trade off between growth and emissions reduction is related to the type or pattern of growth of each country. In the case of Brazil, the energy-intensive extractive-export dynamic has and will have future impacts on gas emissions and climate impact and cannot be neglected in terms of future costs in efforts to reduce emissions. For example, only the prospects for pre-salt exploration radically change the profile of Brazil's emissions, compared to today, for the post 2020 period



. Therefore, the debate about our standard should be part of the public debate on mitigation efforts. growth.



Regarding the time horizon, we understand that:



2025 is very little time to see any results (thinking that the new agreement should start to take effect from 2020;

2030 gives a whole decade for the international community to see how it works and evaluate the regime and also it gives time for actions to adapt nationally in a more extended horizon.

2050 is a very long horizon, it is to guarantee (even legally) the 'transition' in the horizon that, for example, business lobbies and major investment actors want. We find long-term commitments very complicated and risky, for example, Brazil has to live up to 2020 with the 'commitments' defined in the National Policy on Climate Change that since the end of the last decade (2009) - not so long ago - in peak of agrofuels, placed this element as one of the main pillars of the reduction of emissions in the country, in addition to the expansion of hydroelectric plants and reduction of deforestation 'net' with increment of planted 'forests' (= monocultures). Only five years have passed and the context of the dynamics of development and energy generation is much more complex.




Comments will be sent by email.
 
1st q.- Brazil has not yet shown itself ambitious in the effective reduction of emissions. Its projected reduction in emissions growth is based on a baseline, described in the annex to Decree 7390/2010, which estimates a high rate of economic growth. Little has been done to generate a trend of decelerating growth in emissions from the energy and transportation sectors. The reduction (deceleration) in the growth of emissions expected from deforestation does not necessarily represent a permanent victory, as the new forestry legislation and policy is more permissive in terms of the need to restore and recover degraded and deforested vegetation.

Brazil has an economy that is expressive globally. It fears common and differentiated responsibilities from other developing countries, when emissions are projected - baselines for the next 20 years (prospective application of the principle). Therefore, in order to slow down, stabilize and cut emissions, the country must have goals that are not merely “voluntary”, it must have more ambition and responsibility for the environmental balance, necessary for the sustainable development of its population and to avoid impacts across the planet.

2nd q -The options and their underlying assumptions in the 2nd question apparently seek a scenario of less interference in the economy due to measures to deal with climate change, on the one hand, and the search for social reasons (education and health) to justify little ambition and lethargy in the urgent adoption of transition policies for the environmental sustainability of human development. Among these policies are also the tax, investment and reorientation policies of important sectors (energy, transport, agriculture) towards sustainability.

The options presented are based on the view that taking care of the environment hinders economic and social “development”.

Now, we must consider that the omission, inaction or insufficiency of mitigation will bring great damage to the economy, and that the appropriate actions and policies will provide an increase in sustainable activities (see example of renewable energy, agroforestry, etc. Consider studies such as: (i) The coordinated by Nicholas Stern, who stated that “who pointed out that cutting emissions at the level indicated by the IPCC to avoid dangerous interference in the climate system would represent around 1% of world GDP over the next few decades, while the omission and insufficiencies in actions and policies could cause a loss of 5 to 20% of annual GDP ”(Born, Rubens, 2014); (ii) The coordinated by Margulis, Dubeux & Marcovitch:" Economics of climate change in Brazil: costs and opportunities " The study indicated that “National GDP losses would be between R $ 719 billion and R $ 3.6 trillion, which would be equivalent to throwing away at least a full year of growth in next few 40 years, the average annual loss for the Brazilian citizen would, in 2050, between R $ 534 and R $ 1,603. "

3ªq: The seriousness of climate change implies the adoption of policies with multiple approaches to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness reduction of emissions in different sectors and in different regions of the country. Carbon pricing is an approach that can be reconciled with that of “command-control” by setting maximum emission limits, for example. It is also necessary to have parameters such as total emissions in Brazil, by sector and per person (per-capita), in several reference years (2025, 2030, 2040, 2050) in order to be able to establish the most appropriate targets for the lowest possible climate impacts.

4th q -There must be a plan that contemplates multiple periods, by sector and by region. These periods will have different objectives: a) a deceleration in the growth of emissions, whether due to improvements in technologies, production processes, goals for reducing GHG intensity per GDP or product unit; b) a period ... continues in the adaptation block at (*)

Justification of the 1st question:



The "mitigation effort" depends essentially on a better structuring of the administrative structure of the Brazilian State (Union, States, DF and Municipalities) in the environmental area. The administrative scrapping of agencies such as IBAMA, the precariousness of state agencies and the almost inexistence of municipal environmental agencies prevent progress on the topic. In addition, some legal mitigation instruments have not been put into practice by the Government's absolute inertia, such as, for example, the National Solid Waste Policy.

It is important to rethink the axes that guided the elaboration of Complementary Law 140/2011, especially with regard to the criterion for environmental licensing (scope of the degree of impact), as well as the licensing by each federated entity based on this criterion (maintaining the possibility of inspection by all). LC 140/2011 should also define the general criteria for licensing, avoiding creating too many difficulties for entrepreneurs. The best control is still achieved through environmental licensing, which is why there is an urgent need to rethink it to make it really efficient.

Finally, contrary to what one of the alternatives presented in the form suggests, we maintain that the performance of the Brazilian State in the area of ​​land and forest use constitutes the weakest point and is contrary to the mitigation of the effects resulting from climate change. The option for the soy monoculture and extensive livestock model is perhaps the biggest responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions and savanization of the Amazon Forest. The repeal of Law 4,771 / 65 and the amnesties granted to degraders, especially with regard to cutting vegetation in areas of permanent preservation, was a recent measure of the Brazilian State totally contrary to the objectives of the PLMC.



---------



Justification for the second question:



There are three alternatives that we consider compatible and not excluding: (1) It is acceptable that mitigation actions imply some degree of reduction in economic activity; (2) Action should be taken to reduce the growth rate of emissions, without impeding economic and social development. (3) The collective benefits of mitigation actions outweigh possible economic losses in specific sectors.

There are several ways to define and quantify a national mitigation contribution, according to the specific obligations and circumstances of each country. Under the Kyoto Protocol, for example, developed countries have quantified targets for reducing or limiting emissions over a base year, which apply to their entire economy. Developing countries, for their part, presented their mitigation actions appropriate to national conditions to the Convention, as agreed in the Bali Action Plan. The diversity of such actions is great: they cover absolute goals, relative goals, sectoral policies and plans, specific programs and projects, etc.

Another relevant aspect is the conjunction of the PNMC with the National Consumer Relations Policy, since we are unable to envision how an action plan can be formulated without also discussing a profound review of consumption patterns. The role of education for sustainable consumption is absolutely essential so that mitigation actions do not result in damage to the country's economic and social development.

The country should focus on planning and in this planning identify the stages of the contribution, based on possible achievements, determining the periods and stages of the contribution, field research, determination of actions and actions to be taken.

A National Adaptation Plan seems to be a stronger response or commitment to the problem presented, since it should contain national objectives, presentation of best practices (see Adaptation Bank of Practices available at http://www.coepbrasil.org .br / projectsdeadaptacao / Público / default.aspx), monitoring systems.

The main areas of concern in a National Adaptation Plan or at the UNFCC should be: housing, mobility, food and nutrition security, energy security, water resources, biodiversity, work, health and disaster risk prevention and reduction, with priority for populations. vulnerable. Women, children, blacks and indigenous populations deserve special attention, since in addition to constituting majorities of the population, inequalities of gender, race and ethnicity are structuring inequalities and poverty in Brazil. For that, it is necessary the wide social participation in the processes of elaboration and implementation of public interventions; social control; decentralization and synergy between policies; making investments in research and education; mapping vulnerabilities; prevention; the creation of early warning systems; strengthening family farming; the preservation of biodiversity.

Finally, it is important to note that the development of an adaptation plan to the human impacts of climate change must understand the concept of adaptation not as an end in itself, nor only from the point of view of the consequences, but also of the causes of the problem. Adaptation should be understood as the adjustment of social, economic and environmental systems to the current and expected effects of global warming, preventing their impacts in order to reduce vulnerability, especially of the poorest communities and regions, to climate change or variability. In this sense, adaptation must be part of a general public policy plan to tackle climate change that combines, on an equal footing, prevention, adaptation, resilience and mitigation.

Energy Sector: high dependence on hydroelectricity



Sanitation: water supply



Infrastructure: impact on society in general and on the economy as a whole
- Energy sector due to the high participation of hydroelectricity in the national electrical matrix

- Sanitation, since the issue of water supply has proved to be a great challenge already in 2014

- Infrastructure, since any impact will bring great economic and social losses in an infrastructure currently already insufficient to meet the demand for economic growth

- Agribusiness, an important sector in the national economy, with the presence of many medium and small producers unaware of climate risks, and a sector with a large consumer of natural resources, especially water.
An adequate strategy for adapting to climate change for Brazil, as well as for any other nation, requires the identification and assessment of vulnerabilities and opportunities for adaptation and increased resilience, both in regional and local terms and within the scope of different sectors of the economy. In a nation that is territorially extensive and with immense social, cultural and species diversity like our country, it is critical to consider the insertion of adaptation strategies based on ecosystems and communities in a national strategy on adaptation, in order to empower communities and local populations. to deal with and reduce their vulnerabilities, and for the good management of well-preserved natural ecosystems to contribute to increased resilience in the face of climate change. The Climate Observatory considers it important that the Brazilian Government register with the UNFCCC its National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change (currently under development). Although this Plan is not the subject of this consultation, it must be constructed, also considering the recommendations and guidelines of the UNFCCC, such as those made by the UNFCCC in its Decision 5 / CP.17, which demands that the National Adaptation Plans must include objectives of reducing the country's vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, through the construction of adaptive capacity and resilience, and of enabling the integration of the logic of adaptation to climate change, in a coherent way, into policies, programs and actions, new and existing , and determined development processes and strategies, in all relevant sectors and at different levels (national, regional, local, etc.), as needed. It also recommends that the National Plan include targets, monitoring and evaluation indicators and means of implementation.

Brazil is one of the main countries threatened by Climate Change. A National Adaptation Strategy is essential for the country to be prepared for the impacts of Climate Change. The Brazilian Government has already started the process of developing the National Adaptation Plan, this process is in its initial stages but there is an urgent demand for joint action by the entire federal government and the specific ministries for each agenda. The Adaptation Working Group has 9 subgroups that must have the effective participation of representatives of civil society and an effective discussion with different sectors and grassroots organizations. The Adaptation Plan must be concluded with the effective participation of civil society, which includes all the diversity of the country. The plan should consider strategies that consider alternatives that promote forest and biodiversity conservation, increasing its resilience to Brazilian society and the populations that depend on natural resources for their survival. It is expected that this year a first version of this Plan will be finalized and that it will be presented and discussed at the international level with a view to it being presented at the Paris COP as yet another national contribution to the international process.

Agroforestry transition in areas of monocultures and pastoralism, aiming at increasing biomass and consequent carbon capture and social inclusion.
The socioeconomic and environmental vulnerability of traditional communities, they usually depend directly on the environment to survive, and consequently any change has major impacts. In the environmental field, one of the areas that deserves attention is the Pantanal, it is here in Brazil that we have the largest freshwater wetland in the world and this is simply not taken into account. This humidity system is complex and sensitive to climate changes and especially anthropic changes, deserves a more careful assessment.
New consumer consumption habits, less disposable products. Intensify information in order to disseminate the principles of the 3Rs: reduce, reuse and recycle. Socioeconomic opportunities with "Ecoeconomics" and / or "Green Economy", such as organic food, clean energy and products from recycling and reusing materials.
As a member of the FBMC's Working Group on Climate Change and Poverty, based on the reflections made in the WG, I believe that the promotion of a National Adaptation Plan is a sine qua non condition to face the issue of adaptation to climate change. The PNMC, containing national objectives, presents the best practices and monitoring systems; it establishes a strategic path that could be an important element to guide Brazilian negotiating positions in adaptation.

For the WG, the main areas of concern in Brazil for the preparation of the National Adaptation Plan must be: housing, mobility, food and nutrition security, energy security, water resources, biodiversity, work, health and disaster risk prevention and reduction, with priority for vulnerable populations. Women, children, blacks and indigenous populations deserve special attention, since in addition to constituting majorities of the population, inequalities of gender, race and ethnicity are structuring inequalities and poverty in Brazil.



An important element in this elaboration is the broad participation of civil society in the processes of elaborating and implementing public interventions; social control; decentralization and synergy between policies; making investments in research and education; mapping vulnerabilities; prevention; the creation of early warning systems; strengthening family farming; the preservation of biodiversity.



It is important to emphasize that the elaboration of an adaptation plan to the human impacts of climate change must understand the concept of adaptation not as an end in itself, nor only from the point of view of the consequences, but also of the causes of the problem. Adaptation should be understood as the adjustment of social, economic and environmental systems to the current and expected effects of global warming, preventing their impacts in order to reduce vulnerability, especially of the poorest communities and regions, to climate change or variability. In this sense, adaptation must be part of a general public policy plan to tackle climate change that combines, on an equal footing, prevention, adaptation, resilience and mitigation.

Among the various ways to adapt to climate change

is Ecosystem-based Adaptation, which considers the use

of biodiversity and environmental services as part of a

comprehensive adaptation strategy to help people adapt to the adverse effects

of climate change ( CDB, 2009).

Ecosystem-based Adaptation intentionally uses “green infrastructure” and ecosystem services to increase the resilience of human societies to climate change. It concerns how ecosystems can help people to adapt to current climate variability and future climate change. Its objective, therefore, is to constantly reduce the vulnerability of communities to the adverse effects of climate change.

Despite their need and effectiveness, Ecosystem-based Adaptation measures are still not treated with due importance by the government. The Brazilian Panel on Climate Change (Executive Summary: Impacts, Vulnerabilities and Adaptation, 2013) indicates as one of the gaps identified for Freshwater and Terrestrial Ecosystems, the need to implement strategies for adapting to ongoing changes, pointing out that there are already some Adaptation initiatives based on Ecosystems, combining nature conservation with human development, however, these initiatives need to gain scale.

In order to debate climate change and measure its effects on the biodiversity of the Atlantic Forest, the Grupo Boticário Foundation (FGB) has supported, since 2011, projects aimed at the study of this theme through the Bio & Clima Lagamar public notice, whose coverage area includes the Mosaic of Protected Areas of Lagamar (Paraná coast and the south coast of São Paulo).

Annually, the researchers of the supported projects and the managers of the UCs of Mosaico Lagamar meet to discuss how the results of the research can help in the management of the region, with an emphasis on adaptation to climate change.

R $ 1 million has already been invested in 9 projects, and together with FAPESP we are selecting projects until September / 2014 for another R $ 5 million.

A National Adaptation Plan is presented as a more efficient measure to combat the problem presented.

The main areas to be addressed in a National Adaptation Plan should be: housing, mobility, food and nutrition security, energy security, water resources, biodiversity, work, health and disaster risk prevention and reduction, with priority for populations in vulnerable situation. Women, children, blacks and indigenous populations also deserve special attention, since inequalities of gender, race and ethnicity are structural factors of inequalities and poverty in Brazil.

There is a need for broad social participation in the processes of designing and implementing public interventions; social control; decentralization and synergy between policies; making investments in research and education; mapping vulnerabilities; prevention; the creation of early warning systems; strengthening family farming; the preservation of biodiversity.

Finally, it is important to note that the development of an adaptation plan to the human impacts of climate change must understand the concept of adaptation also for the causes of the problem. Adaptation is understood as the adjustment of social, economic and environmental systems to the current and expected effects of global warming, preventing its impacts in order to increase resilience and decrease vulnerability, especially for the poorest communities and regions, to change or variability. climate change. In this sense, adaptation must be part of a general public policy plan to tackle climate change that combines, on an equal footing, prevention, adaptation, resilience and mitigation.
An adequate strategy for adapting to climate change requires the identification and assessment of vulnerabilities and opportunities for adaptation and increased resilience, both in regional and local terms and within the scope of different sectors of the economy. In this sense, it is essential that adaptation plans are sensitive not only to differences in vulnerability between rural and urban populations, but also between different social and economic groups in each of these contexts (eg women, children, small farmers, the elderly and etc). In a nation that is territorially extensive and diverse and with notable social and economic inequalities, it is critical to consider the existence of different levels of resilience to the effects of climate change within Brazilian society. It is essential to insert into the national adaptation strategy mechanisms and instruments that aim to increase the capacity of local communities and populations to understand their vulnerabilities and ways to reduce them. We consider it important that the Brazilian Government register with the UNFCCC its National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change that is being developed. Although this Plan is not the subject of this consultation, it must be constructed considering the UNFCCC recommendations and guidelines, such as those made by UNFCCC in its Decision 5 / CP.17, which demands that the National Adaptation Plans should include objectives to reduce the country's vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, by building capacity for adaptation and resilience, and enabling the integration of the logic of adaptation to climate change, in a coherent way, into policies, programs and actions, new and existing, and processes and determined development strategies, in all relevant sectors and at different levels (national, regional, local, etc.), as needed. And it recommends that the National Plan include targets, indicators for monitoring and evaluation and means of implementation.

As a Contribution to the Adaptation Plan, we understand as a premise to ensure the maintenance of life, establishing that this is the priority.

Adaptation policies must meet the demands of a deficient and unfair social situation. Societies and ecosystems are shaken by climate change, which involves us all, however, the poor populations and in areas at risk are and will always be the most impacted and this in any nation.

In this sense, it is essential to relate the impacts of climate change on the working class and communities, strengthening the academy so that it can produce studies of the impacts of climate change on employment and on the lives of workers, since it is certain that in certain sectors there will be a significant loss of jobs.

Mitigation measures, adaptation measures and the development of research must address the pillars of building a fair and adequate working environment, which mainly addresses these issues in the world of work:

Fair Transition, Decent Work, Green Jobs.

The Adaptation Plan should guide government actions in relation to public policies that develop training programs for male and female workers in various sectors related to the Plan.

The Plan should develop a tripartite line for discussing actions, expanding existing policies and promoting new policies related to education and professional qualification, which guarantee the adequacy of employment to the new work paradigms.

Fair Transition

Invest in job-creating sectors that reduce the impact of productive activities on the environment.

Create Fair Transition agendas at regional and national level, so that, adapted to different realities, equivalent results are achieved in terms of sustainability and job quality as well as justice and well-being.The establishment of social protection content in the programs common transition rules for the entire working population, ensuring healthy and safe work.

Decent Work

The concept of decent work is defined by the ILO itself, the International Labor Organization and is based on four strategic objectives:

Fundamental principles and rights of labor (elimination of all forms of forced labor; effective abolition of child labor; elimination of all forms of discrimination in terms of employment and occupation);

Productive and quality employment; Social protection; Social dialogue. The ILO defines the concept of decent work as productive and quality work, under conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity.

Green and Decent Jobs

Promote decent jobs in economic activities that contribute significantly to reduce carbon emissions or to improve / conserve environmental quality in a sustainable and progressive manner.

To guarantee the training of workers on clean processes and technologies and to take advantage of the potential for green investments, eradicating slave and child labor.
In the area of ​​adaptation, special attention should be paid to the impacts and reflexes of

Brazilian actions on the resilience and capacity of adaptation of neighboring countries. For example, an

increase in deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado can have important impacts

on the climate of the Andean countries and the southern cone.
Brazil is one of the main countries threatened by Climate Change. A National Adaptation Strategy is essential for the country to be prepared for the impacts of Climate Change. The Brazilian Government has already started the process of developing the National Adaptation Plan, this process is in its initial stages, but there is an urgent demand for joint action by the entire federal government and the specific ministries for each agenda.

The Adaptation Working Group related to the National Adaptation Plan has 9 subgroups that must have the effective participation of representatives of civil society and an effective discussion with different sectors and grassroots organizations. The main areas of greatest concern, such as water, biodiversity, food security, energy, etc., therefore, are already covered. Our greatest concern today, then, is the fact that the Adaptation Plan must be concluded with effective participation by civil society, which includes all the diversity of the country, including minority groups such as youth and indigenous people. Such a plan must also consider strategies that consider alternatives that promote forest and biodiversity conservation, increasing its resilience to Brazilian society and the populations that depend on natural resources for their survival. It is expected that this year a first version of this Plan will be finalized and that it will be presented and discussed at the international level with a view to it being presented at the Paris COP as yet another national contribution to the international process, establishing a direct dialogue between the different areas

I begin with the following question: is the growing economy bigger than a decent life? What logic is used to measure economic growth? The relationship between humanity and nature is considered, but the impacts of the first in the second are not externalized and thus they say there is an economy which I disagree. For there to be something more, it must be done and especially with regard to the capitalist way of life, in which there is a false freedom. Therefore, conservation and harmonious life must overcome the harmful and symptomatic emissions of the mode of production, which in turn is overcome.
Plans are instruments, among several public policies. They should consider both the observed impacts and the most likely expected impacts, based on available scientific studies. Early warning systems, articulated among the various federative entities, should enable the public manager to make decisions in a timely manner to redirect preventive or corrective investments.

Greater control and rigor in the application of legislation for the use and occupation of urban and rural land are necessary, either to prevent increasing vulnerability or to correct risks that already exist for different populations and regions.

Funds, such as the North and Northeast Constitutional Funds, the National Climate Change Fund and many other governmental support instruments, must internalize and prioritize the cost of mitigation and adaptation actions. The National Climate Change Fund should establish a schedule to gradually expand the use of non-reimbursable resources, in such a way that they go from the average of 10% to at least 50% of the available resources, to be used in adaptation, education and social mobilization. , search.

to make decisions in a timely manner to redirect preventive or corrective investments. Greater control and rigor in the application of legislation for the use and occupation of urban and rural land are necessary, either to prevent increasing vulnerability or to correct risks that already exist for different populations and regions. Funds, such as the North and Northeast Constitutional Funds, the National Climate Change Fund and many other governmental support instruments, must internalize and prioritize the cost of mitigation and adaptation actions. The National Climate Change Fund should establish a schedule to gradually expand the use of non-reimbursable resources, in such a way that they go from the average of 10% to at least 50% of the available resources, to be used in adaptation, education and social mobilization. , search. (*) continuation of comments from the mitigation block: b) a period to stabilize the country's total emissions, by sector, in order to, based on equity, allow economically less expressive regions to reach levels of social well-being or that may promote environmental resilience; c) a third period, to start in 2030, or earlier, for the effective reduction of Brazilian emissions. By the eco-efficiency criterion, carbon intensity parameters per product or service can also be used. Baselines, with estimated economic growth projections, should not be the only reference, which is the case of current national legislation.
 
 
 
 
Within the “developing” countries category, there are very different realities and conditions. In the case of Brazil, yes, it is acceptable to assume part of the actions to combat climate change with its own resources. But this should not mean giving up the "ecological debt" and "repair" debate, which is unfortunately almost lost.

In addition, in the debate on the means of implementation, the Brazilian government should oppose any market mechanism as a form and source of provision of necessary resources for global and national climate policy.
 
 
Every plan, when implemented, needs indicators to assess whether the expected results are being achieved.
 
 
 
 
Orientation to the positioning of Brazil in defining its contribution to the New Agreement. Brazil is a large emerging economy that has the capacity to direct its own resources to its policies, measures and actions for mitigation and adaptation to climate change and should have eliminated extreme poverty by 2020. A significant amount of resources is today allocated to policies and actions mitigation and adaptation. We have, for example, a set of Sectorial Mitigation and Adaptation Plans, which have federal budget resources for their execution. In addition, Brazil has the National Fund on Climate Change, which finances some important adaptation actions and subsidizes the elaboration of the National Adaptation Plan.



Sources of funds: we believe that Brazil has reached a considerable degree of development and therefore can afford part of the necessary measures to implement its national contribution to the UNFCCC. However, considering criteria for equitable distribution of commitments and targets for the new agreement, Brazil must still be eligible to receive international resources to effectively and fully implement its national contribution to the new agreement under the Convention. For example, with regard specifically to REDD +, Brazil already implements actions with the support of international cooperation resources (such as projects financed by the Amazon Fund, which has resources from Norway and Germany). With the creation of a potential REDD + mechanism under the UNFCCC, it will be natural for the country to be able to receive resources due to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions linked to deforestation and forest degradation and other REDD + activities (conservation, sustainable management of increase in forest carbon stocks).



South-South cooperation. Brazil already develops cooperation actions with other developing countries, especially with less developed countries, in important areas, such as monitoring of vegetation cover. This cooperation does not depend solely and exclusively on the existence of external resources, so it is recommended that the country cooperate, to the extent of its capacity, in different ways, such as in training and transfer of knowledge and technology. However, if there are resources in the scope of international cooperation, the UNFCCC and the Green Climate Fund, these cooperation actions can be intensified.
positive agenda, mobilization of public and private social actors, adequate incentive mechanisms, opportunities for an economy with low GHG emissions, training, development, cooperation and transfer of technologies with lower GHG emissions and adaptation, energy transition from fossil sources to renewable and more efficient sources, consumption and production patterns suitable for sustainable development (with lower emissions)

Resource sources. Negotiation within the UNFCCC to define emission reduction targets for all countries, for the post-2020 period, includes a wide debate on equitable distribution of commitments and targets. Therefore, the target to be defined for Brazil should, as well as for the other countries, correspond to its share of responsibility and its capacity for action. Brazil is a large emerging economy that is in a position to make significant commitments to reduce and limit its greenhouse gas emissions, starting in 2020. External resources, arising from a REDD + mechanism within the scope of the UNFCCC, by recognizing performance of the country in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, may eventually contribute to the country's progress in its efforts in an area that already has important international cooperation resources (see Amazon Fund, which has resources from Norway and Germany ).



South-South cooperation. Brazil already develops cooperation actions with other developing countries, especially with less developed countries, in important areas, such as monitoring of vegetation cover. This cooperation does not depend solely and exclusively on the existence of external resources, so it is recommended that the country cooperate, to the extent of its capacity, in different ways, such as in training and transfer of knowledge and technology. However, if there are resources in the scope of international cooperation, the UNFCCC and the Green Climate Fund, these cooperation actions can be intensified.
Question 1 - As an emerging economy, Brazil now has its own resources and must assume its responsibilities. If you go beyond that, you must have support from other countries for that. Actions to reduce emissions and combat climate change must be carried out in parallel and / or integrated with efforts to eradicate poverty. Forms of international cooperation must be developed, related to advanced technologies or emission control of sectors of the economy with international trade in goods (steel, aluminum, etc.), without necessarily being a condition of action

Question 2 - The Brazilian goal must be achieved with its own resources and Brazil must support other countries through the transfer and sharing of knowledge and technology. If the goal is reached, Brazil can go further with international financial support.

Question 3 - Brazil can contribute to international financing, if a scale is agreed in which the countries that are able to contribute proportionally according to their capacities.

Brazil is still a developing country, but as we all know, it has great potential with regard to natural resources, the consumer market and strategic geographic leadership in the Americas. It should focus on education and make the most of information and resources from developed countries to train manpower and apply them to national and international cooperation projects (South-South initiatives).  
It is important that Brazil continues to assume part of its actions to combat climate change with its own resources. But this should not mean giving up the debate on “ecological debt” and “reparation”, which is so important in the discussion about financing and which is mostly invisible.

Regarding the means of implementation, the Brazilian government should oppose any market mechanism as a form and source of provision of necessary resources for global and national climate policy. This is because, on the one hand, the market, in addition to being one of the main causes of the problem, and therefore, leaving the solutions in his hands would be to take steps back when seriously seeking a policy to face climate change; on the other hand, the market aims at profit opportunities, in this way, the climate policies via market mechanisms that are being carried out aim to create more markets and not actually stop the advance of climate change. The disastrous carbon market demonstrates this, in the sense of being ineffective for its "main objective", even though it has been successful in creating a new financial architecture for new markets related to what is called the economy of nature. States must guide these policies and be the main actors in implementing them.

The best would be to talk about payment of “ecological debt” and “reparation”. If this option is not available, the position chosen is at least harsh in the sense of charging and conditioning the resources that the developed countries owe.
 
Regarding means of implementation, it is important that in the cooperation of countries there is the fulfillment of the commitments of developed countries, listed in the Convention, in Article 4.7, mainly on financial, technological resources and training to implement mitigation and adaptation actions. However, there is a need for a better definition of what economic development model we are looking to implement so that we can have a clearer view on prioritizing actions.

Brazil has been developing cooperation actions with other developing countries, especially with less developed countries, in important areas such as monitoring of vegetation cover. Brazil's way of cooperating, based, above all, on meeting the demands of countries that seek inspiration in Brazilian policies for the development of their own analogous policies that are appropriate to their realities seems advisable. We therefore understand that the country must make itself available to cooperate, to the extent of its capacity and on a voluntary basis, providing training and transfer of knowledge and technology according to the demands placed by partner countries. If there are resources in the scope of international cooperation, the UNFCCC and the Green Climate Fund, these cooperation actions can be intensified.

The bipolar division of the world between developed and developing does not make sense

today and does not reflect the complexity of the current situation. As countries like China, India, Brazil and

South Africa that are able to come together to create their own multilateral bank and already

account for almost a third of global emissions, they may want to qualify as “under

development” with differentiated commitments on the same basis. really

much more needy countries ?

Brazil must be consistent with its aspirations to play a leading role in the international agenda and

propose that large emitters and middle-income countries have

different commitments from the poorest and least developed countries.

On the other hand, the issue of commitments must not be conditioned on the priority of

economic development in the same way that freedom,

democracy, gender equality and the fight against racism are not conditioned, for example . The lesson of Rio_20 is clear in this

sense, there is no development without sustainability. Growing5 and developing on low

carbon means a cleaner, healthier life, with better and longer-lived jobs and

especially in a healthier environment.

Brazil can and should partner with other countries to capture and expand opportunities

to reduce emissions as quickly as possible while promoting

emissions reduction, as it does today, for example, with CDM, technical cooperation and with the

Amazon Fund .

However, Brazil should not condition any commitment to the existence of so-called means of

implementation. You can even argue that these are available to countries that really

need them, but making it clear that this is not Brazil's limitation. Brazil can and should even

expand its south-south cooperation efforts in this regard.
Question 1 - As an emerging economy, Brazil now has its own resources and must assume its responsibilities. If you go beyond that, you must have support from other countries for that. Actions to reduce emissions and combat climate change must be carried out in parallel and / or integrated with efforts to eradicate poverty. Forms of international cooperation must be developed, related to advanced technologies or emission control of sectors of the economy with international trade in goods (steel, aluminum, etc.), without necessarily being a condition of action

Question 2 - The Brazilian goal must be achieved with its own resources and Brazil must support other countries through the transfer and sharing of knowledge and technology. If the goal is reached, Brazil can go further with international financial support.

Question 3 - Brazil can contribute to international financing, if a scale is agreed in which the countries that are able to contribute proportionally according to their capacities.
It is widely recognized that poverty reduction and climate change mitigation go hand in hand. Climate change, in all its most damaging dynamics, knocks on the door of the most vulnerable. It is extremely erroneous to consider that intensive carbon development brings more benefits to economically disadvantaged and more vulnerable populations than development driven by renewable energies, for example. Dirty, centralized and poorly diversified energies maintain the status quo and strengthen the maintenance of poverty.



Greenpeace believes that each country - each individual, regardless of nationality - has the same rights to social and economic development. But the right to develop does not mean the right to pollute. As an organization, Greenpeace requires financial and technology transfers from developed countries to developing countries, according to commitments already made, and assesses that countries should support each other according to their capacity. We believe that Brazil, as the seventh economy in the world and a nation that ranks among the ten largest emitters, should contribute its own resources to its mitigation and adaptation policies, measures and actions, considering the need for additional resources according to its level of development. , if necessary, and providing, according to their capacity, resources for less developed and more vulnerable countries, without being tied to any effective contribution from developed countries.
Within the “developing” countries category, there are very different realities and conditions. In the case of Brazil, yes, it is acceptable to assume part of the actions to combat climate change with its own resources. But this should not mean giving up the "ecological debt" and "repair" debate, which is unfortunately almost lost.

In addition, in the debate on the means of implementation, the Brazilian government should oppose any market mechanism as a form and source of provision of necessary resources for global and national climate policy.

The north axis is given as the upper part and the south axis as the bottom, respectively, in an economist point of view, the importance that Brazil has in the south axis, mainly in Latin America is enormous, in addition to that the practice of a new society must be exercised in internationalist mechanisms as well as that adopted by developed countries.
The first three alternatives in question 1 of means of implementation are still linked to a rhetoric of two decades past, which can no longer be the Brazilian position in 2014. Brazil has resources for investments in appropriate mitigation and adaptation actions. It is about choosing and making decisions for appropriate sustainable development policies. The investment for the purchase and manufacture of new FAB fighter planes is comparable to the one-year budget of the Ministry of the Environment. The investment in the Pre-Salt is much higher than what was spent in 20 years in Brazil to deal with climate changes.

It is politically and morally indefensible the option to condition the implementation of Brazilian actions to the granting of resources from abroad.

However, resources from the duty (and principle) of international cooperation will be most welcome, for application in more critical or more vulnerable areas. On the other hand, this duty-principle of cooperation, registered in the UNFCCC, must also be practiced by Brazil. Brazil can cooperate with other developing countries, in the so-called South-South cooperation, and notably in Latin America. In our region, we share hydrographic basins and biomes: now we are upstream (Paraná and Paraguay basins) or downstream (Amazonian basin), and therefore influencing and being influenced by the dynamics related to the impacts as well as the causes of emissions of GHG in anthropic processes that occur in such regions.

Furthermore, President Lula, at CoP-15, in Copenhagen, committed the country to collaborate financially with other developing countries for adaptation actions.

Brazil should support less developed countries to implement a cleaner development model, however, Brazil will focus on making its energy matrix cleaner by seeking partnerships with already developed countries in this regard, and establishing improvements in its country to serve as an example for others countries.

I believe that Brazil has a differentiated historical responsibility in relation to the Annex-I countries. However, it is time to change the discourse and assume your own capacity to reduce emissions, implement mitigation and adaptation activities and be more proactive than waiting for the position of other countries. With regard to sources of international resources, again, I understand that international aid would be very welcome, however, there are hundreds of other countries that need this support more than Brazil.

Brazil needs to unify international discourse with internal policies. While taking on emission reduction and deforestation reduction goals, it has a plan to build dozens of hydroelectric plants in the Amazon, explore the pre-salt.

Brazil has enormous potential to stand out economically if it starts to adopt the bases of an economy low carbon, developing more efficient and sustainable agriculture and looking at the forest as an opportunity and not an obstacle.

It must drive an ambitious global agreement through the adoption of ambitious goals as well.
The criterion comes from its strategic planning, that is, it has to take into account its contribution to the new agreement.
 
A central issue in which Brazil needs to play a decisive role concerns the role of the markets, whether there will be or not, and how the mechanisms will be, how the proposed offset credits (compensation) will enter (or not) in the new agreement and also the proposals for non-market approaches. See more at http://br.boell.org/pt-br/2014/06/09/rumo-um-acordo-internacional-sobre-o-clima#_ftn5

According to what was decided on the REDD + approach in Warsaw , the financing of actions to reduce deforestation and forest degradation do not generate offset credits that can be accepted to offset obligations of Northern countries under the Convention. This is valid in the current rules, as advocated by Brazil on the interpretation of approved devices. Position with which we agree.

However, it does not define what it will be like from 2020, with the new agreement. Thus, keeping forests and the REDD + approach completely out of the markets and the possibility of generating offset is still a very important task to be guaranteed when formatting the agreement in 2015.

Our organization is part of the articulation called Grupo Carta de Belém (http: / /grupocartadebelem.wordpress.com/about/)que which brings together socio-environmental organizations and movements, workers and family and peasant farmers, agroextractive workers, quilombolas, women's organizations, urban popular organizations, fishermen, students, peoples and traditional communities and peoples who share the fight against deforestation and for environmental justice.

We share the political position of rejecting market mechanisms as an instrument to reduce carbon emissions, based on the firm certainty that the market is not the space capable of assuming responsibility for life on the planet http://issuu.com/ongASE/ docs / carta-de-belem.

In the case of 'land use', the 'landscape scale' approach that has been integrating forests and agricultural production has been strengthened. We are concerned with the way in which the topic of agriculture is intensively entering the mitigation agenda. The package that has been placed on the negotiating table, strongly defended by the agribusiness lobby and driven by the countries of the North and the World Bank, mainly includes support for direct planting, mechanization, certified / genetically modified seeds to 'resist drought', in addition to financing and agricultural insurance that deepen the link between agriculture and mechanisms for financializing policies.

We argue that Brazil should not be against this package only because of the real risks that mechanisms of this nature are used as 'climate' barriers or restrictions to international agricultural trade. But also because, domestically and sovereignly, we must re-discuss our growth pattern strongly based on exporting agribusiness, expanding and complexing the debate about the relationship between this pattern and the dynamics of emissions derived from land use.
 
 
It has been observed that in the previous agreements, goals / objectives are well below what is actually being accomplished in practice. In this sense, it is important that in the new agreement the agreed goals are achievable.
 
 
Assumptions: Brazil is a country with great potential for economic growth and, consequently, for emissions



Principles: Common but Differentiated Responsibilities should continue to be the principle defended by the country in international negotiations
Brazil has to consider that, although it is a developing country, we have registered development and economic growth. This has led to an increase in our GHG emissions. We have our responsibility in the process and we have to commit ourselves to proactive actions for economic growth and the reduction of emissions simultaneously, always considering, of course, the Principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities.

 
For purposes of defining the contribution Nationally Determined, the Climate Observatory recommends that the assumptions below

. the Brazilian Government must guide its negotiating positions and define its Nationally Determined Contribution in a manner consistent with the objective of stabilizing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a level that prevents dangerous anthropic interference in the climate system, and corresponding to the responsibility of the Brazil and its capacity to face the challenge of climate change;



. regardless of the allocation rules that will guide the allocation of future responsibilities and the corresponding targets for reducing and limiting greenhouse gas emissions under the post-2020 agreement, all major greenhouse gas emitting countries will have to effect substantial reductions in its emissions in the post-2020 period, so that it is possible to maintain global warming within the limit of 2 degrees Celsius;



. the level of ambition of each country's target (or set of targets), including the Brazilian post-2020 emission reduction target within the scope of the UNFCCC, must correspond to the necessary contribution portion of that country for the trajectory of global emissions, by the year 2050, maximize the possibilities of maintaining global warming within the limit of 2 degrees Celsius;



. the nationally determined contribution intended by the Brazilian Government, to be communicated to the UNFCCC and its signatory countries, with significant advance in relation to COP21, must not be conditioned to the contributions intended by any of the other UNFCCC signatory countries, nor to its date of your communication; the Observatório do Clima considers that significant advance is the deadline recommended by decision 1 / CP.19: first quarter of 2015;



. the IPCC, in its 5th Assessment Report, Working Group 2 (WGII), concluded that an increase in global temperature of the order of 2 degrees Celsius already represents a serious threat to human well-being;



. the concentration of greenhouse gases, expressed in CO2eq, must be limited to the range of 430 to 480 ppm at the end of the 21st century so that there is a greater probability of maintaining global warming within the limit of two degrees Celsius; cumulative CO2 emissions from 2011 to 2050 should be limited to 825 Gt;



. the set of scenarios of the IPCC AR5, which results in at least 66% of possibilities to prevent global warming from exceeding the limit of 2 degrees Celsius, corresponding to a limit of global emissions of greenhouse gases of 20Gt CO2eq in 2050; considering the World Bank's projection of a global population of approximately 9.5 billion inhabitants in 2050, the maximum global per capita emissions for that year should range between 1.0 and 2.1 Gt CO2e;



. net Brazilian emissions in 2010, according to MCTI estimates, were in the order of 1.2 Gt CO2eq;



Thus, Observatório do Clima strongly recommends to the Brazilian Government, therefore, that, for the purpose of defining its Nationally Designated Contribution, consider that the necessary contribution to Brazil, corresponding to its responsibility and capacity to face the challenge of climate change, should be below the limit of 1 Gt CO2eq in 2030. The Climate Observatory also recommends that the Brazilian Government submit a proposal for a Nationally Determined Contribution to the UNFCCC that includes, in addition to the 2030 target, an intermediate emission reduction target, or a limit of intermediate greenhouse gas emissions for the year 2025.
positive agenda, mobilization of public and private social actors, adequate incentive mechanisms, opportunities for an economy with low GHG emissions, training, development, cooperation and transfer of technologies with lower GHG emissions and adaptation, energy transition from fossil sources to renewable and more efficient sources, consumption and production patterns suitable for sustainable development (with lower emissions)
A central issue in which Brazil needs to play a decisive role concerns the role of the



markets, whether there will be or not, and how the mechanisms will be, how the proposed



offset credits (compensation) will enter (or not ) in the new agreement and also the proposals for



non-market approaches. See more at http://br.boell.org/pt-br/2014/06/09/rumo-um-

According to what was decided on the REDD + approach in Warsaw , the financing of actions to



reduce deforestation and forest degradation do not generate offset credits that can be



accepted to offset obligations of Northern countries under the Convention. This is valid in the current



rules, as advocated by Brazil on the interpretation of approved devices. Position with



which we agree.



However, it does not define what it will be like from 2020, with the new agreement. Thus, keeping forests and the



REDD + approach completely out of the markets and the possibility of generating offset is still



a very important task to be guaranteed when formatting the agreement in 2015.



Our organization is part of the articulation called Grupo Carta de Belém (http: / /



grupocartadebelem.wordpress.com/about/)que that brings together socio-

environmental organizations and movements , workers and family and peasant farmers, agroextractive workers,



quilombolas, women's organizations, urban popular organizations, fishermen, students,



peoples and traditional communities and peoples who share the fight against



deforestation and for environmental justice.



We share the political position of rejecting market mechanisms as an instrument to



reduce carbon emissions, based on the firm certainty that the market is not the space capable



of assuming responsibility for life on the planet http://issuu.com/ongASE/ docs / letter-of-design

.



In the case of 'land use', the 'landscape scale'



approach that has been integrating forests and agricultural production has been strengthened . We are concerned with the



way in which the topic of agriculture is intensively entering the mitigation agenda. The package



that has been placed on the negotiating table, strongly defended by the agribusiness lobby



and driven by the countries of the North and the World Bank, mainly includes support for



direct planting , mechanization, certified / genetically modified seeds to 'resist drought', in addition



to financing and agricultural insurance that deepen the link between agriculture and mechanisms



for financializing policies.



We argue that Brazil should not be against this package only because of the real risks



that mechanisms of this nature are used as 'climate' barriers or restrictions



to international agricultural trade. But also because, domestically and sovereignly,



we must re-discuss our growth pattern strongly based on exporting agribusiness,



expanding and complexing the debate about the relationship between this pattern and the dynamics of



emissions derived from land use.
As highlighted by the last report of the IPCC, we are experiencing a reality of urgency in actions to reduce emissions. In this context, it is widely known that a global climate agreement for 2020 is essential for it to be possible to reduce the impacts of climate change on the world population. The international process needs an urgent positioning of the main issuing countries, not only on the goals and contributions from 2020, but on how a low carbon development process will begin before 2020. The 5th IPCC Report emphasized that the concentration of greenhouse gases, expressed in CO2eq, should be limited to the range of 430 to 480 ppm at the end of the 21st century.

Brazil, as a country of paramount importance for the global economy and for BASIC, should continue to be a protagonist in innovative emission reduction policies and initiatives for an effective reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the maintenance of temperature changes within 2ºC.

The national contribution must be based on scientific analysis, equity and historical responsibilities, aiming at a contribution that maintains the variation of 2ºC in the global average temperature. Some calculators and initiatives are trying to contribute to this discussion, bringing subsidies, such as: http://www.gdrights.org/calculator/.

Scientific analyzes still highlight the need for urgent action to reduce emissions in the coming years. An intensive carbon development path can bring very high costs for the transition of the matrix and a time that can put at risk the reduction of emissions and the maintenance of 2ºC.

Some national initiatives could lead Brazil to the path of a low carbon future:

• Establish a goal of reducing net deforestation to zero, implementing decisions, policies and initiatives that lead to a future that pursues this objective;

• Implement initiatives in the transport and urban mobility sector that seek significant reductions in the sector, with international maritime transport taxation initiatives discussed at the international level;

• Review of sectoral plans including ambitious scenarios for reducing national emissions based on the calculation of the national reduction necessary to ensure climate security;

• Investments that consider basic premises for the promotion of low carbon technologies and that foster an increase in the population's resilience;

• Goals to increase the share of alternative renewable energy in the Brazilian matrix;

• Reduction and elimination of policies and incentives that are contrary to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, such as subsidies to fossil fuels;

• Investment in low carbon technological alternatives and international cooperation in their implementation.

• Increase social participation and transparency in decision-making processes on decision making at the international and national level of Climate and Energy.

All of these assumptions underscore the need for Brazil to do its part to reduce the temperature, reducing its emissions below the levels of 1 Gt CO2eq by 2030, with intermediate targets, and effective actions to reduce emissions at the national level before 2020 .

 
 
Brazil must support measures to strengthen the international regime in addition to targets and contributions from individual countries, which can support and accelerate the reduction of global emissions. Some of these measures would be:

• Sectoral agreements for, for example, steel, cement, etc .;

• Agreements for minimum efficiency standards for appliances, cars, equipment, etc;

• Renewable energy increase targets;

• Elimination of fossil fuel subsidies;

• Mechanisms or instruments to transfer large-scale investments from dirty to renewable, clean and low-carbon technologies;

• Measures to control emissions from maritime transport and international aviation.

Such elements would need to be negotiated, and not only depend on Brazil's decision, but Brazil may signal an interest in starting negotiations for these purposes.

Final comment:

As an organization led and composed only of young people, Engajamundo believes that this questionnaire was prepared in a very technical way , requiring in-depth knowledge on the topic, which prevents the participation and collaboration of the Brazilian population as a whole in this public consultation. We encourage Itamaraty to organize consultations in a more accessible language so that youth and other minority groups can be properly and legitimately represented in the responses.

For purposes of defining the contribution Nationally Determined, the Climate Observatory considers that:



. the position of the Brazilian Government within the scope of the UNFCCC must be guided primarily by the Convention's major objective: stabilization of concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a level that prevents dangerous anthropic interference in the climate system; the scientific and political consensus defines 2 degrees Celsius of global warming as the relatively safe ceiling that reflects that objective;



. the Nationally Determined Contribution intended by the Brazilian Government should not be conditioned on those intended by any of the UNFCCC signatory countries;



. regardless of rules to be defined for allocating emission reduction targets between countries, all major emitters of greenhouse gases will have to substantially reduce their emissions in the post-2020 period in order to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius;



. the set of scenarios of the IPCC AR5 that maximizes the possibilities of keeping the warming below the limit of 2 degrees Celsius corresponds to a maximum of global emissions of 20Gt CO2eq in 2050; with a projected global population of 9.5 million inhabitants (World Bank), global emissions per capita should be between 1.0 and the maximum of 2.1 Gt CO2e in that year; it is estimated that Brazil will have 223 million inhabitants in 2050 (IBGE); the country's net emissions in that year must be less than 0.5 Gt CO2eq;



. Mathews et al. (2014) indicate that Brazil has a historical responsibility of 4.9% in relation to the observed global warming, caused by human actions, and is the 4th. most responsible for this heating; Höhne et al. (2013) propose that the reduction of emissions in the group of Latin American countries compatible with the limit of 2 degrees Celsius for 2030 is between 15% and 49% in relation to 2010 indexes, when analyzing various approaches for sharing mitigation efforts ; net Brazilian emissions in 2010 were of the order of 1.2 Gt CO2eq (MCTI);



. simulations made based on the application of the methodology proposed by the Climate Equity Reference Calculator (EcoEquity and Stockholm Environment Institute), which allows estimating the responsibility of each country for future emission reductions based on the definition of quantitative indicators of capacity, historical emissions and development), indicate that an adequate target for Brazil for 2030, could be about 0.6 GtCO2eq, or even lower than this value, depending on the weight given to each indicator;



The Climate Observatory therefore considers that the Brazilian target for 2030 should result in net emissions of greenhouse gases below 1 GtCO2eq in that year.



To support the definition of its emission reduction goals, the Brazilian Government must carry out analyzes that consider different proposals for equitable allocation of mitigation efforts, presented by countries within the UNFCCC, observers and experts, including the Brazilian proposal on historical responsibilities , adjusted to assess the potential effect of cumulative emissions by country on increasing global temperature.



The Climate Observatory considers that it is fully feasible for Brazil to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to levels well below 1 GtCO2eq in 2030. Based on the definition of appropriate policies, measures and investments, the country could achieve a reduction of up to 50 % of its emissions in 2030, in relation to the 2010 indexes (1.2 Gt CO2eq).



In order to promote the necessary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions according to its responsibility and capacity in the post-2020 period, it is essential that the country strategically incorporates the logic of development based on progressive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. greenhouse and resilient to climate change in all its set of major development policies and plans.

The inclusion of "Prevention" mechanisms, that is, effective prevention tools and / or systems that can reduce the recurring impacts of extreme weather events that have been occurring in the country, should be evaluated.
In our view, education and information technology should be priorities in Brazil's approach. Another important topic is the enhancement of our natural resources, giving priority in this case to sustainable projects for generating income and technology, which are essential for Brazilian society as a whole.

Despite successive failures in relation to the market solutions proposed in the last 20 years of the UNFCCC negotiations, some governments continue to insist on promoting market mechanisms within the regulatory climate framework for solving the climate crisis. Negotiations on financing for the mitigation mechanism have been moving in this direction. It has been demonstrated since the creation of Kyoto that the focus of the Convention, rather than on meeting the objective of the Convention, was to institutionalize the carbon market within the United Nations and within the signatory countries. It is increasingly evident that the creation of the Clean Development Mechanism and its implementation in developing countries have been increasing the negative local impacts where projects are installed, amplifying situations of environmental injustice and human rights violations and do not effectively contribute to the reduction emissions. We participate in a national articulation of civil society organizations - Grupo da Carta de Belém - which is concerned with the issues raised above.
 
A central issue in which Brazil needs to play a decisive role concerns the role of the markets, if there will be, and how the mechanisms will be, how the offset credits (compensation) proposals will enter (or not) in the new agreement and also the proposals for non-market approaches.

We share the political position against market mechanisms as an instrument to reduce carbon emissions, based on the firm certainty that the market is not the space capable of assuming responsibility for life on the planet.

In the case of 'land use', the 'landscape scale' approach that integrates forests and agricultural production has been strengthened. We are concerned with the way in which the topic of agriculture is intensively entering the mitigation agenda. The package that has been placed on the negotiating table, strongly defended by the agribusiness lobby and driven by the countries of the North and the World Bank, mostly includes support for direct planting, mechanization, certified / genetically modified seeds to 'resist drought', in addition to financing and agricultural insurance that deepen the link between agriculture and mechanisms for financializing policies.

We argue that Brazil should not be against this package only because of the real risks that mechanisms of this nature are used as 'climate' barriers or restrictions to international agricultural trade. But also because, domestically and sovereignly, we must re-discuss our growth pattern strongly based on exporting agribusiness, expanding and complexing the debate about the relationship between this pattern and the dynamics of emissions derived from land use.
We believe that Brazil should observe as a general criterion and guiding element of its contribution the issue of promoting equity at the international and national level. In this sense, the definition of its contribution, and the elaboration of public policies that will allow the country to honor its commitment, must be permeable not only to the objective of eradicating poverty, but, above all, to the fundamental issues that perpetuate social inequalities, economic opportunities and opportunities for Brazilian citizens and other countries. Efforts to increase the resilience of the most vulnerable groups must be based on the development of their adaptation capacities and on the collaboration of all social and economic groups, to the extent of their capacities, to move towards a less carbon-intensive economy.



It is essential to make adaptation and mitigation plans and any public policy more susceptible to the practical challenges arising from the varying levels of severity of the impacts of climate change on different social groups, and especially on those most vulnerable, making the increase in resilience capacity of these groups a common and transversal objective to all and any effort of the State in the commitments assumed in the national and international sphere.
For purposes of defining contribution Nationally Determined, I consider that:



. the position of the Brazilian Government within the scope of the UNFCCC must be guided primarily by the Convention's major objective: stabilization of concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a level that prevents dangerous anthropic interference in the climate system; the scientific and political consensus defines 2 degrees Celsius of global warming as the relatively safe ceiling that reflects that objective;

Brazil must support measures to strengthen the international regime in addition to targets and contributions from individual countries, which can support and accelerate the reduction of global emissions. Some of these measures would be:

• Sectoral agreements for, for example, steel, cement, etc .;

• Agreements for minimum efficiency standards for appliances, cars, equipment, etc;

• Renewable energy increase targets;

• Elimination of fossil fuel subsidies;

• Mechanisms or instruments to transfer large-scale investments from dirty to renewable, clean and low-carbon technologies;

• Measures to control emissions from maritime transport and international aviation.

Such elements would need to be negotiated, and not only depend on Brazil's decision, but Brazil may signal an interest in starting negotiations for these purposes.

            Some national initiatives could lead Brazil to the path of a low carbon future:

• Establish a goal of reducing net deforestation to zero, implementing decisions, policies and initiatives that lead to a future that pursues this objective;

• Implement initiatives in the transport and urban mobility sector that seek significant reductions in the sector, with international maritime transport taxation initiatives discussed at the international level;

• Review of sectoral plans including ambitious scenarios for reducing national emissions based on the calculation of the national reduction necessary to ensure climate security;

• Investments that consider basic premises for the promotion of low carbon technologies and that foster an increase in the population's resilience;

• Goals to increase the share of alternative renewable energy in the Brazilian matrix;

• Reduction and elimination of policies and incentives that are contrary to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, such as subsidies to fossil fuels;

• Investment in low carbon technological alternatives and international cooperation in their implementation.

• Increase social participation and transparency in decision-making processes on decision making at the international and national level of Climate and Energy

Final comment:

As an organization led and composed only of young people, Engajamundo believes that this questionnaire was prepared in a very technical way , requiring in-depth knowledge on the topic, which prevents the participation and collaboration of the Brazilian population as a whole in this public consultation. We encourage Itamaraty to organize consultations in a more accessible language so that youth and other minority groups can be properly and legitimately represented in the responses.
The Brazilian Government must commit to a 60% reduction in total emissions from the energy sector by 2050, in relation to the projected in the reference scenario of the [R] Energy evolution (that is, we would go from 777 million ton / year to 312 ). In other words, this means that, even considering the growth in energy consumption in the different areas (transport, industry, electricity generation, etc.), we would still maintain the sector's emissions, in 2050, 13% below the emissions of 2010. The cumulative reduction proposed in this scenario would be equivalent to 5 billion tons of CO2, 465 million tons in 2050 alone.



We have a weak and minimally ambitious Sectorial Transport and Urban Mobility Plan (PSTM). In this new global phase of emission reduction, Brazil must commit itself to building a robust emission reduction policy in the sector with clear targets and deadlines with potential for mitigating the sector (including gradual targets interspersed to the maximum for a period of three years and modal shift in cities from the motorized individual to the quality collective and the non-motorized individual); annual investments by the Federal Government in improving mobility around 2.1% of GDP (R $ 92.4 billion, considering a GDP of R $ 4.4 trillion), instead of the 0.45% that the government currently invests ; and, in this phase of modal transition, adoption of an energy efficiency target for light vehicles produced in the country of 1.22 MJ / KM by 2021.



In addition, the Brazilian commitment for the post-2020 period must consider very strongly realities such as the one that indicates that the pasture alone currently represents 62% of the entire deforested area in the Brazilian Amazon. No substantial reduction in emissions from the agricultural sector will occur if there is not a consistent policy to change this situation. Among other things, the government must establish, in the ABC Plan and in the ABC Program, environmental criteria that strengthen the correct implementation of the six axes of mitigation envisaged, with an emphasis on the recovery of degraded pastures in the North and Northeast. It should also withdraw credit lines that benefit activities that are harmful to the environment, in addition to increasing the synergy between the ABC Plan and the PPCDAM and PPCerrado programs.

We know that the situation that has contributed to the fall in deforestation in recent years is changing with the gradual resumption of economic growth in countries that import Brazilian products and the revitalization of the musculature of the sector most responsible for deforestation - agribusiness, which has been collecting victories (such as the Forest Code) that put in check the entire framework of environmental protection hard-built by the country. Nor can we forget that the new cycle of construction of infrastructure works in the Amazon, such as hydroelectric dams and roads, adds pressure on the forest, being currently one of the factors that most contribute to the rate of deforestation in the region.

It is known that the survival of forests will not be guaranteed only by the free play of the market, as it is enough that the “forest asset” has less value than the asset generated by its loss, for the forces that leverage deforestation to return to full operation. charge. Nor is the pressure from environmentalists and social movements sufficient to stop the gears that move this machine in the face of the profits that the conversion of forests provides.



Discussing the causes of deforestation implies, therefore, facing the challenge of proposing changes to the way the central axis of the Brazilian economy works since the colonial period - the production and export of agricultural commodities anchored in the expansion and conversion over forest areas. It also requires creating objective assessment parameters regarding what is gained and what is lost with deforestation, demonstrating that forest conservation policies benefit the country's economic and social development.
A central issue in which Brazil needs to play a decisive role concerns the role of the markets, whether there will be or not, and how the mechanisms will be, how the proposed offset credits (compensation) will enter (or not) in the new agreement and also the proposals for non-market approaches. See more at http://br.boell.org/pt-br/2014/06/09/rumo-um-acordo-internacional-sobre-o-clima#_ftn5

According to what was decided on the REDD + approach in Warsaw , the financing of actions to reduce deforestation and forest degradation do not generate offset credits that can be accepted to offset obligations of Northern countries under the Convention. This is valid in the current rules, as advocated by Brazil on the interpretation of approved devices. Position with which we agree.
For the purposes of defining the Nationally Determined Contribution, we consider: - Brazil's position in the UNFCCC must be guided by the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that prevents warming above 2 degrees Celsius; - Brazil's Nationally Determined Contribution must not be conditioned on the positions of the other UNFCCC signatory countries; - All emitters of greenhouse gases will have to substantially reduce their emissions in the post-2020 period, aiming to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius; - The set of scenarios of the IPCC AR5 that maximizes the possibilities of keeping the warming below the limit of 2 degrees Celsius corresponds to a maximum of global emissions of 20Gt CO2eq in 2050; with a projected global population of 9.5 million inhabitants (World Bank), global emissions per capita should be between 1.0 and the maximum of 2.1 Gt CO2e in that year; it is estimated that Brazil will have 223 million inhabitants in 2050 (IBGE); the country's net emissions in that year must be less than 0.5 Gt CO2eq; - Mathews et al. (2014) indicate that Brazil has a historical responsibility of 4.9% in relation to the observed global warming caused by human actions, and is the 4th. most responsible for this heating; Höhne et al. (2013) propose that the reduction of emissions in the group of Latin American countries compatible with the limit of 2 degrees Celsius for 2030 is between 15% and 49% in relation to 2010 indexes, when analyzing various approaches for sharing mitigation efforts ; net Brazilian emissions in 2010 were of the order of 1.2 Gt CO2eq (MCTI); - Simulations made based on the application of the methodology proposed by the Climate Equity Reference Calculator (EcoEquity and Stockholm Environment Institute), which allows estimating the responsibility of each country for future emission reductions based on the definition of quantitative indicators of capacity, historical emissions and development), indicate that an adequate target for Brazil for 2030, could be about 0.6 GtCO2eq, or less than this value, depending on the weight given to the indicators; The Brazilian target for 2030 should result in net emissions of greenhouse gases below 0.6 GtCO2eq in 2030. To support the definition of its emission reduction targets, the Brazilian Government must carry out analyzes that consider different proposals for equitable allocation of mitigation efforts, presented by countries under the UNFCCC, observers and experts, including the Brazilian proposal on historical responsibilities, adjusted to assess the potential effect of cumulative emissions by country on the increase in global temperature. It is absolutely feasible for Brazil to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to levels below 0.6 GtCO2eq in 2030. Based on the definition of appropriate policies, measures and investments, the country could achieve a reduction of up to more than 50% of its emissions in 2030, in relation to the 2010 indexes (1.2 Gt CO2eq). In order to promote the necessary reductions in greenhouse gas emissions according to its responsibility and capacity in the post-2020 period, it is essential that the country strategically incorporates the logic of development based on progressive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. and resilient to climate change throughout its set of public policies and development plans.








































Brazil's collaboration should be carried out primarily in Latin America, due to the historical context, later if possible to extend to Central America.
Necessary to start - studies of contingency plans to face the inevitable climate crisis (because it is already happening ...).

In other words, instead of just thinking about reducing GHG (you have to think but even if we could, we would already be above 2ºC) to structure survival mechanisms now (without wars and or economic crises).

Finally, it is necessary to envisage, both nationally and internationally, ways of meeting possible migratory flows of environmental refugees from the climate crisis.



There is also a need to look for ways to expand eco-efficiency in existing structures, both for public services and private sector activities. For example: the climate crisis already has an impact on water catchment systems, reservoirs and public supply in large and medium-sized cities (ex: metropolitan region of SP). stimulating policies and practices (in the case, for example, of reusing water and sewage, capturing rainwater for less demanding uses, etc.) will serve both as an adaptation response and as a way to avoid (mitigate) future emissions in the search (construction) new sources of supply of goods and services.



Brazil should, despite the multilateral regime, also propose a South American agreement, in view of the potential impacts of climate change on the continent, and we should share the basins with neighboring countries.

However, it does not define what it will be like from 2020, with the new agreement. Thus, keeping forests and the REDD + approach completely out of the markets and the possibility of generating offset is still a very important task to be guaranteed when formatting the agreement in 2015.

Our organization is part of the articulation called Grupo Carta de Belém (http: / /grupocartadebelem.wordpress.com/about/)que which brings together socio-environmental organizations and movements, workers and family and peasant farmers, agroextractive workers, quilombolas, women's organizations, urban popular organizations, fishermen, students, peoples and traditional communities and peoples who share the fight against deforestation and for environmental justice.

We share the political position of rejecting market mechanisms as an instrument to reduce carbon emissions, based on the firm certainty that the market is not the space capable of assuming responsibility for life on the planet http://issuu.com/ongASE/ docs / carta-de-belem.

In the case of 'land use', the 'landscape scale' approach that has been integrating forests and agricultural production has been strengthened. We are concerned with the way in which the topic of agriculture is intensively entering the mitigation agenda. The package that has been placed on the negotiating table, strongly defended by the agribusiness lobby and driven by the countries of the North and the World Bank, mainly includes support for direct planting, mechanization, certified / genetically modified seeds to 'resist drought', in addition to financing and agricultural insurance that deepen the link between agriculture and mechanisms for financializing policies.

We argue that Brazil should not be against this package only because of the real risks that mechanisms of this nature are used as 'climate' barriers or restrictions to international agricultural trade. But also because, domestically and sovereignly, we must re-discuss our growth pattern strongly based on exporting agribusiness, expanding and complexing the debate about the relationship between this pattern and the dynamics of emissions derived from land use.
The means of implementing international cooperation activities that aim to provide developing countries with financial, technological resources and capacity to implement mitigation and adaptation actions must respect the limits of financial commitment of each country so that it does not prejudice their internal policies, the that would result in a common loss for all participants.

Criterion: Brazil should promote a new model of development with cleaner technologies and a reduction in this capitalist / consumerist model, we cannot encourage the people to consume unrestrained nor produce unrestrained, we must reduce planned obsolescence.



Assumptions:



There must be an exchange of clean technologies, mainly in the energy issue, such as biodigesters of organic residues, photovoltaic, wind and others.



we must make a plan to disconnect / reduce the use of fuels as the main actor in the energy source (as Germany and a few countries are doing)



The benefits generated by Brazilian environmental services countless countries benefit, however, not all bear the burden the costs of keeping these services active.



The energy efficiency of goods that consume energy in general must be increased, this reflects in the emission and demand for energy, allowing the country to grow more with the same energy (as the USA).



Main premise: The country has to be serious about the environmental / energy issue, this will reflect in improvements in the economy and in the quality of life of people. Rampant corruption cannot enter this area of ​​the country, as this reflects in a discredit of Brazilian environmental action, which has enormous potential;



The goals assumed must be in accordance with the real possibility of putting into practice, less ambitious goals, but possible to be achieved.



The country is one of the most biodiverse and has an immense potential in environmental activities, and cannot be held hostage to this immensity of environmental resources with the extraction and use of these resources in an unsustainable way, we must use this capacity to add positively, no let localities / cultures be destroyed by resource extraction;



Traditional communities must have their culture strengthened, making them the providers of environmental services, combining international / national tourism with the development and maintenance of environmental services, favoring the roots of our Brazil, not entrepreneurs who want mansions in green areas and sea shores, they will not perceive and take actions that will keep environmental services strengthened;



I wrote at another time, countless contributions, but the computer turned off and I lost the writing, I synthesized the ideas in this new filling, I hope I contributed.



Environmentalist greetings!
